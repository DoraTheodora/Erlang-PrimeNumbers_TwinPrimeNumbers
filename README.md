### Prime Numbers

There are an infinite number of prime numbers. Amongst the primes there are what are known as twin primes.

A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime numberâ€”for example, either member of the twin prime pair: ``` (41, 43)```. In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two. Sometimes the term twin prime is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair.

It is (currently) unknown whether there are an infinite number of twin primes. 

<b>Examples include: </b> 
```code
(3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41,43),... 
```

The task is to write a parallel program that counts the number of primes less than n for any number n and also finds and lists all twin primes less than n. The code should run on linux.

<b>Example output after running code with n = 50 would be: </b>

```code
>
primeTwinCount 50

Total number of primes: 15

Twin Primes: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 29, 31, 41, 43

<b>The project consists of: </b>

- Source Code 

<b>Full source code includes: </b>
 - README
 - full installation instructions
 - Makefile 
 - Doxygen 
 - Configuration file
 - Report 

    A short report on the approach took to achieving maximum concurrency. This will contain:

        1. Pseudocode Outline of the algorithm illustrated with pseudocode;

        2. Speedup Results Both absolute speedup and relative speedup should be calculated

        3. Scalability Graph(s) showing the scalabiltiy of the code.

    The report does not need to be long. It must be concise and on point.
